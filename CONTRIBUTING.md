# Contributing to Spending Transaction Monitor

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your help keeps this project strong, usable, and evolving.

This document outlines how to prepare your contributions, what conventions to follow, and how to get your changes merged.

---

## 🧰 Branching Strategy

- Use one of the allowed prefixes for branch names:  
  `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `ci/`, `build/`, `perf/`
- Examples:  
  `feat/user‑endpoints`  
  `fix/health‑timeout`
- Branch naming is enforced via Git hooks (`prepare-commit-msg` and `pre-push`).

---

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

- Follow **Conventional Commits** format.  
- Some examples:  
  - `feat(api): add transactions POST`  
  - `fix(db): correct alembic URL driver`  
  - `chore(ui): update dependencies`  
- Constraints:  
  - Subject header must be ≤ 100 characters.  
  - Commit linting is enforced via hook (commit-msg) and also on pre-push for all commits since upstream.

---

## 🔍 Pre‑commit and Pre‑push Hooks

- **pre-commit** (runs on staged changes only):  
  - UI: `Prettier --write` and `ESLint` on changed JavaScript/TypeScript/React files  
  - API: `ruff format` and `ruff check` for changed Python files
- **pre-push** (runs more extensive checks across the repo):  
  - Rejects non-conventional branch names  
  - Runs `commitlint` on all commits since upstream  
  - Runs formatting, linting, and tests via e.g.  
    ```bash
    pnpm format:check
    pnpm lint
    pnpm test
    ```

## 🔄 Releases
